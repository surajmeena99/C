Ans. Array will store multiple values of same data type (int only, char only),
     but structure can store values of multiple dafta types (int, char,double all).


syntax:- 
       struct structurename 
       {
        datatype1 var1, var2, var3;
        datatype2 var3, var4;
       };
       main(){
       struct structurename varname;
       }
